# MNIST-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN in Python with Keras

### DESCRIPTION
  
This is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive.
It achieved 98.51% of accuracy with this CNN trained on a GPU, which took me about a minute. If you dont have a GPU powered machine it might take a little longer, you can try reducing the epochs (steps) to reduce computation.

### Code Requirements

python 3.x with following modules installed

      numpy
      seaborn
      tensorflow
      keras
      opencv2
To run the code type,

      python digit_recogniser.py
      
### Tutorial

##### Need help for this to be completed

For step-by-step tutorial please refer to wiki. It will take you through all the steps right from loading the data to recognising digits through live cam.
